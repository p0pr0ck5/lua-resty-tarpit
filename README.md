## Name

lua-resty-tarpit - capture and delay unwanted requests

## Status

lua-resty-tarpit is in early development and is considered production ready.

## Description

lua-resty-tarpit provides rate-limit protection for sensitive resources. It leverages Nginx's non-blocking archtitecture to artificially increase response latency for resources that are repeatedly accessed. This functionality is designed to protect resources that are publicly accessible, but vulnerable to some form of brute-force attack (e.g., web application admnistrative login pages). It was inspired by the TARPIT iptables module.

## Installation

Clone the lua-resty-tarpit repo into Nginx/OpenResty's Lua package path. Module setup and configuration is detailed in the synopsis.

## Synopsis

```lua
	http {
		lua_shared_dict tarpit 10m;

	    server {
	    	location /login { # or whatever resource you want to protect
	    		access_by_lua '
	    			local t = require "resty/tarpit"
	    			t.tarpit(
	    				5, -- request limit
	    				5, -- reset timer
	    				1 -- delay time
	    			)
	    		';
	    	}
	    }
	}
```
